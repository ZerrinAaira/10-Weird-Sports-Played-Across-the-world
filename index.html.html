<h1> 1. Fireball Soccer </h1>
<img src="Football.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
Have you ever believed that soccer couldn't get any crazier?
Well, you're in for a surprise! Fireball Soccer is here to shake things up. Instead of a regular ball, they use a coconut soaked in gasoline for a whole week, and then set it on fire during the game!
And if that's not daring enough, just picture playing the game without any shoes on!

<img src="face.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
Get ready for a super weird competition! It's all about making THE ugliest face and whoever does it best wins! You might think it's something crazy new, but gurning contests actually started way back in 1297 at a fair in the UK. It's a big tradition, and you can be part of it! Come and cheer on these brave folks as they try to twist their faces into the most horrifying, ugliest expressions ever!

<h1> 3.Kaiju Big Battle </h1>
<img src="battle.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
Kaiju Big Battle is a really cool and different show! It's like a wrestling match mixed with sci-fi movies and art. Everyone wears these amazing costumes that make them look like crazy creatures. They fight in a pretend 'cage' with tiny buildings around them. It's a totally unique event that some people dreamt of being monsters instead of heroes like the Power Rangers when they were kids!

<h1> 4.Cycleball </h1>

<h1> 5.Sepak Takraw  </h1>
<img src="Sepaktakraw.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
"Sepak Takraw" means "kickball" in another language. It's a super cool sport that mixes volleyball and football together. It's kinda like the Matrix with those crazy martial arts moves. The teams are made up of three players on each side of the net. They score points by kicking the ball over to the other team without using their hands. It takes a lot of skill and fancy footwork!

<h1> 6. Underwater Hockey  </h1>
<img src="underwater.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
Underwater hockey is a super cool sport. Instead of playing on land, it takes place underwater! The players use paddles to push a puck into the other team's goal. It's not only hard to play, but watching it is even more challenging because it's all underwater!

<div class = "column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
<h1> 7. Ostrich racing  </h1>
<img src="ostrich.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
Ostrich racing is a really popular sport that started in Africa and is now done in the United States too. Ostriches are super fast and can run really, really fast, almost 70 km per hour! Watching them race is really exciting and gets your heart pumping!

<h1> 8. Quidditch  </h1>
<img src="quid.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
For all the Potterheads in existence, this is an absolute dream realized! The concept of Quidditch, the enchanted game from the world of wizards, has captivated fans to such an extent that they have transformed it into an actual sport. In this unique game, a team of seven players navigates the field with brooms between their legs, incorporating elements reminiscent of rugby, dodgeball, and tag.

<h1> 9. Unicycle Polo  </h1>
<img src="uni.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
Polo, known for its elegance and sophistication, is a sport associated with the elite. On the other hand, Unicycle Polo is an entirely different story. Instead of horses, participants navigate the field on one-wheeled cycles, adhering to the same rules and objectives. However, the level of difficulty is significantly heightened, and it becomes nearly impossible to maintain a straight face while observing someone engage in this unique version of the sport.

<h1> 10. Jugger  </h1>
<img src="jugger.jpg" alt="sport">
<p style="font-size:160%;">
This game truly pushes the boundaries of traditional gaming. Jugger, a combat sport inspired by the iconic 80â€™s film Salute of the Jugger, takes on a cinematic flair. In the movie, teams armed with swords, chains, and maces battle it out, while one unarmed player attempts to score using a dog's skull as a ball. Transforming this concept into a real-life game would be considered absurd, with concerns over potential injuries and casualties. As a result, the team and gameplay have been significantly adjusted, while still maintaining their original allure. All the weapons and the dog skull have been replaced with foam-covered props, offering a safer and more enjoyable experience.
